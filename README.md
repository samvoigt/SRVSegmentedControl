# SRVSegmentedControl
A nice segmented control for iOS
###Usage:

(see sample Xcode project in `/SRVSegmentedControlDemo`)

SRVSegmentedControl is a more customizable option to the standard UISegmentedControl. It supports and arbitrary number of items, and can either be set up in IB or programmatically. It emits an event for `UIControlEventValueChanged` whenever a different segment is selected. It's really pretty straightforward.
